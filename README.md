- 👋 Hi, I’m wilson.
- 👀 I’m interested in Computer Science, Software Development, Astronomy, 
Cosmology, Physics and Math.
- 🌱I'm currently learning Python programming. And there is a
lot to learn so this will be a good journey.
- 💞️ I’m looking to eventually collaborate with others and get involved
with creating new and exciting software.
Since I'm fairly new to programming, I will have to
become more familiar with certain concepts.
